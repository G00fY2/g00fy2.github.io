#### Fork of github/personal-website for generating a [personal website](https://g00fy2.github.io) hosted on github pages

For details on how to set everything up, see the original [README](https://github.com/github/personal-website/blob/master/README.md)

### Changes I made

* Add support for company info ([24fcefe](https://github.com/G00fY2/g00fy2.github.io/commit/24fcefe212f21d1599fa57a80466705f43518ee6))
* Add social support for Reddit and Xing ([a85e440](https://github.com/G00fY2/g00fy2.github.io/commit/a85e4401d388aa7247e9de8092c6bcb0fdeb1148))

### Refresh content

Since github pages is static we need to rebuild this project to update the content (e.g. data, repositories, stars, ...).
The easiest way to do so is `git commit -m 'rebuild pages' --allow-empty` and push.
